This project analyzes 100k+ e-commerce records of customers, orders, and sellers to extract business insights and apply Machine Learning for churn detection and review score prediction. The goal is to help businesses understand customer behavior, reduce churn, and optimize retention strategies.

🚀 Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1.) Trends in orders, sellers, and customers

2.) Top product categories and purchase behavior

3.) Payment values, demographics, processing times

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

1.) Handled missing data with forward fill and median imputation

2.) Feature engineering for order status, delivery time, and review scores

Churn Analysis:

1.) Applied Machine Learning models for churn detection

2.) Identified 12% churn rate and retention insights

Review Score Prediction:

1.) Implemented Random Forest Regression

2.) Achieved MSE of 0.365, highlighting key drivers of review ratings

Visualizations:

1.) Order trends over time

2.) Top categories & cancellation reasons

3.) Customer churn distribution
